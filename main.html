	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity: Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity: </b>Space complexity is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take o(n)space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will need O(n2) space.   </p>
